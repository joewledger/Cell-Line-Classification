# Cell-Line-Classification
##---Cell Line Classification Project using SVMs (Support Vector Machines) and Neural Networks
##---Working with Elena Svenson under the direction of Dr. Mehmet Koyuturk
##---We have IC50 values for a bunch of different cell lines for the drug we are testing (SMAPs -- Small Molecular Activators of PP2A)
##---We are going to apply SVM to classify cell lines as either sensitive or resistant to this drug
##---The training input values are the gene expression measurements for each cell line
##---The training output values are the IC50 values discretized into several bins: "sensitive", "undetermined" , and "resistant"
